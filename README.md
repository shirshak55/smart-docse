# Smart DOCSE
DOCSE General Purpose Application

I made it for Kathmandu University. But due to lack of financial support like money for servers etc I am unable to show online demo. If you want to support me or want me to work  please raise issue from issue tab or contact me directly.

Use it as you like according to MIT licence. For setup please use this as a API which is built with Laravel, Vue and Tabler as UI. If you find using it consider donation.
